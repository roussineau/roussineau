### Hi there

I am a **Computer Science Student** with a strong focus on understanding how systems work "under the hood." My passion lies in low-level programming, resource optimization, fundamentals of AI, and videogames.

### 🔧 What I'm Building

I am currently bridging my interests in **Systems** and **AI**:

* 🧠 **LLM from Scratch in C**: Building a lightweight Language Model entirely in C, without external ML libraries.
    * *Focus:* Manual memory management, custom ASCII tokenizer implementation, embeddings, and raw logit calculations (`logit = W.h + b`).
    * *Goal:* To understand Transformer architecture at the bit and pointer level.

* 🎮 **Godot Optimization / Game Dev**: Developing efficient simulations and game mechanics.
    * *Current Project:* **3D Flocking Simulation** optimized with a custom *Spatial Grid* to handle thousands of entities, replacing expensive standard physics collisions.

### 🛠️ Tools & Stack

I am most comfortable in Unix-like environments and prefer tools that offer total control and strong type systems.
