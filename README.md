# Welcome to my profile

**Computer Science Student** with a strong focus on understanding how systems work "under the hood". Low-level programming, resource optimization, fundamentals of AI, and videogames.

### 🔧 Currently building

Merging my interests of **systems**, **optimization** and **AI**:

* 🧠 **LLM from scratch in C**: Building a lightweight Language Model (Toy Language Model) entirely in C, without external ML libraries.
    * *Focus:* Manual memory management, custom ASCII tokenizer implementation, embeddings, and raw logit calculations.
    * *Goal:* To understand Transformer architecture at the bit and pointer level, and get fascinated with the maths behind ML.

* 🎮 **Godot Optimization / Game Dev**: Developing efficient simulations and game mechanics.
    * *Current Project:* **3D Flocking Simulation** optimized with a custom *Spatial Grid* to handle thousands of entities, replacing expensive standard physics collisions.

### 🛠️ Tools & Stack

I am most comfortable in Unix-like environments and prefer tools that offer real control and strong type systems.
